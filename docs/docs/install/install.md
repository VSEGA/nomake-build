Your system must be Windows or Unix-like, support [python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) or [python 3.x.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) and install it (we recomended install python2. If you install python3 use param force-python3=true).**

**If your system meets these requirements, you can continue.**
